# 📚 Three Books That Changed My Life

Books have always been my quiet companions. Some entertain. Some educate. But a few? They _shake something inside you_. These are the three that did that for me — deeply, permanently.

## 1. The Courage to Be Disliked

_By Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga_

This book challenged how I see myself and others. It’s a conversation between a philosopher and a youth, exploring Alfred Adler’s ideas. The biggest lesson? **My past doesn't define me — only my actions now do.**

I used to worry a lot about what others thought. This book helped me realize that **seeking approval can trap you**, and that living honestly — even if it means being disliked — is a kind of freedom. It’s not always easy, but it’s real.

> “Freedom is being disliked by other people.”

## 2. Dopamine Nation

_By Dr. Anna Lembke_

This one hit hard. It explains how addiction works — not just to drugs, but to anything that gives us quick pleasure: scrolling, snacking, YouTube, even working too much. I saw myself in those pages.

It helped me understand the **dopamine–pain balance** and how we’re wired to chase short-term pleasure, even if it leads to long-term pain. I started taking more "dopamine fasts", building habits that feel boring at first — like reading or walking — but restore balance over time.

> “The relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to pain.”

## 3. The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up

_By Marie Kondo_

At first, I thought it was just about cleaning. But it’s really about **intentional living**.

Marie Kondo’s method of asking “Does this spark joy?” became a way for me to evaluate not just objects, but tasks, goals, even people. I started decluttering my home — and then, unintentionally, my life. I found more space to think, more energy to act, and more clarity about what I wanted.

It taught me that **physical space affects mental space** — and that simplifying doesn’t mean losing; it means choosing.

## Final Thoughts

These three books are very different — one’s philosophical, one’s scientific, one’s practical — but they all share one thing: they helped me **see myself more clearly**.

They didn’t just teach me something.  
They changed how I live.

If you’ve read any of these, or have a book that changed _your_ life, I’d love to hear about it.
